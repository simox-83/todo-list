# Todo list APP

This simple web app is a todolist which uses a html template and stores the result in mongodb.

You can use directly the webpage to create a list of items and play with it, by adding, deleting or updating others.

Just run `go run main.go` and hit the browser at `localhost:9000` and you are good to go! 
Note: this requires mongodb installed locally on your laptop.
